# Classification of Living Organism Kingdoms using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify living organisms into their respective kingdoms based on specific features. The notebook includes:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for model training.

- Machine Learning Models: Implementing several machine learning models for classification, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.


Key Features:

- Uses a dataset of living organisms classified into different kingdoms (e.g., Animalia, Plantae, Fungi).

- Preprocessing includes data normalization and handling missing values.

- Compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms.

- Visualizes the model results to better understand the classification outcomes.
